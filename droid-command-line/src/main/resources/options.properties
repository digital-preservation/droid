options.header=OPTIONS:
invalid.options=Invalid usage: use droid -h to print the options.
help.help=Display this help.  More help is available using the help menu in the graphical user interface.
version.help=Display the version of the DROID software.
export.file.help=Export profiles to a CSV file with one row per profiled file.  If any filters are specified, then they will apply to the exported file.  \nFor example: droid -p "C:\\Results\\result1.droid" "C:\\Results\\result2.droid" -e "C:\\Exports\combinedResults.csv" \n droid -p "C:\\Results\\result3.droid" -f "PUID any_of fmt/111 fmt/112" -e "C:\\Exports\\filteredResults.csv"
export.format.help=Export profiles to a CSV file with one row per profiled file/format.  If any filters are specified, then they will apply to the exported file.  \nFor example: droid -p "C:\\Results\\result1.droid" "C:\\Results\\result2.droid" -E "C:\\Exports\combinedResults.csv" \n droid -p "C:\\Results\\result3.droid" -f "PUID any_of fmt/111 fmt/112" -E "C:\\Exports\\filteredResults.csv"
profiles.help=When used in conjunction with reporting, filtering or exporting, -p specifies a list of profiles to open.  \
The file paths of the profiles should be bounded by double quotes, and separated by spaces from each other.  \
When used in conjunction with the -a option, the results of the new profile will be saved to that file, and you can only specify a single file.  \
\n For example: droid -p "C:\\Results\\result1.droid" "C:\\Results\\result2.droid" -e "C:\\Exports\combinedResults.csv" \n\
droid -a "C:\\Files\\A Folder" "C:\\Files\\file.xxx" -p "C:\\Results\\result1.droid"
report.help=Save the report generated to the file specified.  For example:\n  droid -p "C:\\Results\\result1.droid" -n "PLANETS" -r "C:\\Reports\\result1Report.xml"
report.name.help=Run the report with the specified name on any profiles opened using the -p option.  For example:\n droid -p "C:\Results\\result1.droid" -n "PLANETS" -r "C:\\Reports\\result1Report.xml"
all.filter.help=[optional] Filter the profiles specified using the -p option.  Only results which match ALL filter criteria specified will appear.  Filter criteria are specified using the following method: <field><operator><values> where <field> is the name of a filterable field, <operator> is the type of comparison to use, and <values> are the value or values against which the field value should be compared.  The -k option provides information on the available fields and operators.  You can specify more than one filter criteria, bounded by double quotes and separated by spaces from each other.  For example: \
     \n droid -p "C:\\Results\\result3.droid" \n -f "PUID any_of fmt/111 fmt/112" \n -e "C:\\Exports\\filteredResults.csv"\
     \n droid -p "C:\\Results\\result1.droid" \n "C:\\Results\\result2.droid" \n -f "file_size > 0" \n -e "C:\\Exports\\filteredResults.csv"
any.filter.help=[optional] Filter profiles as the -f option does, except results which match ANY of the specified filter criteria will appear.

filter.field.help=List the available fields to use in filters and the operators which can be used with them.
profile.run.help=Add resources to a new profile and run it.  Resources are the file path of any file or folder you want to profile.  The file paths should be given surrounded in double quotes, and separated by spaces from each other.  The profile results will be saved to a single file specified using the -p option. \n For example: droid -a "C:\\Files\\A Folder" "C:\\Files\\file.xxx" -p "C:\\Results\\result1.droid" \n Note: You cannot use reporting, filtering and exporting when using the -a option.
no_profile.run.help=Identify files in a folder without the use of a profile.  The folder path should be bounded by double quotes.  The scan results will be sent to standard output. \n For example: droid -Nr "C:\\Files\\A Folder" \n Note: You cannot use reporting, filtering and exporting when using the -Nr option.
signature_file.help=Specify the signature file to be used for identification.
container_signature_file.help=[optional] The container signature file to be used for identification.  If omitted, container-format files may be identified by container type only.
extension_list.help=[optional] Only identify files with the given extensions \nFor example: -Nx csv jp2
recurse.help=[optional] Recurse into all subfolders of any folder specified using the -a or -Nr options. \
Files in all sub-folders (and their sub-folders, and so on) will be processed as well. \
If this option is omitted, only the files directly under the folder will be processed. \For example: \n droid -R -a "C:\\Files\\Another Folder" -p "C:\\Results\\result3.droid"
archives.help=[optional] Open archive (zip, tar, gzip) files and identify all their contents.
