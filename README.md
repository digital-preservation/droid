# GitHub Pages branch for DROID Website

## How to make a Pull Request and deploy to the website

In order to protect the website, you are required to create a PR before merging to the gh-pages branch; in order to do this, you should:

1. (After cloning the DROID repo) Switch to the `gh-pages` branch
2. Create a new branch based on this branch i.e. `git checkout -b gh-pages-update`
3. Make your changes and push them to GitHub
4. Click the "Compare and pull request" button
5. You Should see "`base:master` <- compare `<your branch name>`"
6. Click the `base:master` dropdown menu and select `gh-pages` which will enable you to see all the changes between the `gh-pages` branch and yours
7. Click the "Create pull request" button
8. Once you get approval, merge the branch
