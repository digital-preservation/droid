        <p>DROID is a software tool developed by <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/" title="The National Archives Website">The National Archives</a> to perform automated batch identification of file formats. Developed by its Digital Preservation Department as part of its broader digital preservation activities, DROID is designed to meet the fundamental requirement of any digital repository to be able to identify the precise format of all stored digital objects, and to link that identification to a central registry of technical information about that format and its dependencies.</p>

<p>DROID uses internal signatures to identify and report the specific file format versions of digital files. These signatures are stored in an XML signature file, generated from information recorded in the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx" title="PRONOM Technical Registry">PRONOM technical registry</a>. New and updated signatures are regularly added to PRONOM, and DROID can be configured to automatically download updated signature files.</p>

<p>The DROID binary zip file is available to download from the <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/" title="DROID download page">dedicated page on The National Archives website</a>.</p>

<p>DROID is a platform-independent Java application. It can be invoked from two interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java Swing GUI</li>
<li>Command line interface</li>
</ul><p>DROID allows files and folders to be selected from a file system for identification. This file list can be saved at any point. After the identification process had been run, the results can be output in various report formats, including CSV.</p>

<h3>
<a name="user-requirements" class="anchor" href="#user-requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User requirements</h3>

<p>DROID requires a minimum of Java 8 Standard Edition (SE). DROID was built and tested on Java 1.8. DROID version 6.6.x will likely operate with Java 7, but this is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>The DROID code base is split up into separate projects, to facilitate only using parts of the DROID code that are required, and to enhance and enforce modularity in its construction:</p>

<pre><code>
droid-api                             Internal API module to include in third party application for easy file identification
droid-binary                          Additional files required in a release build

<p>The required jars can be found in the binary distribution of DROID. </p>

<h3>
<a name="building-droid" class="anchor" href="#building-droid"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building DROID</h3>

<p>DROID was built using Apache Maven 3. First make sure that this is installed
and if behind a proxy, edit the Maven settings.xml file to reflect the proxy
server details. </p>

<p>There are an additional three jar files required, as listed in the dependencies
section above. </p>

<p>These can be installed to your Maven repository from their respective locations 
using the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>mvn install:install-file -Dfile=beansbinding-1.2.1.jar -DgroupId=beansbinding -DartifactId=beansbinding -Dversion=1.2.1 -Dpackaging=jar 
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=org-openide-util-1.jar -DgroupId=org.openide -DartifactId=org-openide-util -Dversion=1 -Dpackaging=jar 
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=swing-outline-1.4.1.jar -DgroupId=org.openide -DartifactId=swing-outline -Dversion=1.4.1 -Dpackaging=jar 
</code></pre>

<p>Once this is complete you can use the master build file under the main DROID
project folder to build the project. This is the pom.xml that sits under
the main DROID folder containing all the sub projects. </p>

<p>Simply run "mvn install" from the command line when in this directory and DROID
will build. Follow the Maven output to see where Maven has placed the binaries.</p>
