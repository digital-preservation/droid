 * A left fragment is all the parts of a byte sequence to

 * be searched for using the fast BoyerMooreHorspool algorithm
 * so their existence is checked for once an anchoring sequence 
 * has been found.
 * 
 * <p/>This subclass of SideFragment is only required so the XML
 * parser can build an instance of this class and assemble the
 * left fragments together.
 * 
 * <p/>Left and Right Fragments are otherwise identical in functionality.
