/**
 * A utility class to transform DROID 4 expression fragments
 * into net.domesdaybook regular expressions. 
 *
 * <p>The only syntactic different between a DROID 4 fragment and
 * net.domesdaybook expressions are in the definitions of sets.</p>
 *
 * <p>DROID 4 uses:
 *  * a ! to indicate an inverted set, whereas net.domesdaybook uses the more standard ^
 *  * a : to indicate a range of values, whereas net.domesdaybook uses the more standard -</p>
 * 
 * <p>net.domesdaybook regular expressions permit case sensitive
 * strings delimited by single quotes ('), and case insensitive
 * strings delimited by back-ticks (`).  In case these are passed
 * in to the rewriter, it will ignore text between these delimiters.</p>
