 * A right fragment is all the parts of a byte sequence to

 * 
 * <p>This subclass of SideFragment is only required so the XML
 * parser can build an instance of this class and assemble the
 * right fragments together.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Left and Right Fragments are otherwise identical in functionality.</p>
