    <h3>
       <a id="JavaVersion" name="JavaVersion">What</a> version of Java do I need?
    </h3>
    <p>
       You will need to have Java 7 or 8 installed on your machine in order to run DROID 6.3.
      The latest JAVA updates can be obtained from <a href=
      "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="EarlierVersions" name="EarlierVersions">Can I open profiles created in earlier
      versions of DROID?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       No. Because of the expanded functionality incorporated in to DROID 6, you will not be able
      to load profiles from previous versions in DROID 6&#44; and vice-versa. &nbsp;If you need to
      re-analyse results in DROID 6 which were already obtained in earlier versions of DROID, you
      will have to re-profile your files using DROID 6.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="NotRecognising" name="NotRecognising">Why isn&#39;t DROID recognising certain
      formats?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID can only recognise files for which there is a defined signature or known extension.
      &nbsp;Signatures are regularly updated by the National Archives, and DROID can download them
      to improve the range of formats it can identify. &nbsp;In some cases, an existing signature
      may fail to recognise a file because the file is unusual in some way. &nbsp;If you know of
      such files, please email <i><a href="mailto:pronom@nationalarchives.gov.uk">pronom@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></i> so we can develop better
      signatures. &nbsp;Note that we usually require&nbsp;a sample of a failing file to find out
      why it is not being recognised. &nbsp;Please make sure that there is no sensitive or personal
      content in such files before sending them.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="FileTimes" name="FileTimes">Why are some file times an hour different to those on my
      system?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID&nbsp;does not record or&nbsp;display dates and times using local daylight savings
      time, if any is configured on your system. &nbsp;The underlying dates and times are correct,
      but represented as universal time. &nbsp;This means that, if your operating system is
      configured to display times using daylight savings time settings, then some times can appear
      to be one hour different to those displayed in DROID.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="MoreAccurate" name="MoreAccurate">Can I configure DROID to give more accurate
      results?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Yes. DROID 6 currently makes identifications of files based on scanning a limited amount of
      the file. The default configuration is set to 64kb (you can change this in the
      Tools&gt;Preferences menu). This is sufficient to return accurate identifications for most
      file-types. There are some exceptions, for example in order to identify some uncommon formats
      (e.g. SIARD files), you will need to scan more or all of the file. If you choose to increase
      the amount of the file that you scan, this is likely to significantly affect the performance
      of DROID, particularly if you have numerous large files.
    </p>
    <p>
       You can also configure whether DROID should match file extensions on all known formats for a
      given file extension, or only on file extensions for which there is no other signature.
      &nbsp;By default, DROID will only match a file extension if there is no other signature
      defined, on the grounds that if the other (usually more accurate) signature failed, it is
      unlikely to be the file format with that extension. &nbsp;Sometimes the more accurate
      signatures will fail to identify a format (e.g. if a newer version has recently become
      available). &nbsp;In these cases, you may want to turn on matching for all extensions.
      &nbsp;This will tend to produce more identifications for&nbsp;a larger number of&nbsp;files.
      &nbsp;More files will have identifications where they did not before, and more files will
      have multiple identifications, instead of a single identification. &nbsp;Whether this is more
      accurate is debatable and will depend on the files and signatures you currently have.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="UseWhileProfiling" name="UseWhileProfiling">Can I continue to use the information in
      the file system whilst I am profiling it?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Yes. If you are running DROID over large file stores, it is conceivable that you may need to
      leave it running for a number of days or weeks. DROID will profile what is there at the time,
      and so over large active locations the results will be gradually built up even while change
      is happening. The eventual profile will therefore not reflect the entire state of your system
      at any one time, but rather the state of each file or folder at the time DROID&nbsp;profiled
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
       You don&#39;t need to worry about users then changing files in the location that DROID is
      profiling; if a file is identified in the file tree but then deleted or moved, it will be
      recorded as an error.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="HowLong" name="HowLong">How long does profiling take?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID 6 is much faster than earlier versions of DROID. &nbsp;However, it depends on how much
      and what type of information you are profiling, what level of accuracy you choose and what
      information you need to get from the results. &nbsp;As a general rule, the larger the volume
      of data you profile the longer it will take for the profile to complete. However DROID will
      also take longer to complete if you chose to:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        Analyse the contents of archive files (e.g. zip, gzip, tar, rar)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 hash</a> <img height="16" width="16"  src=
        "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;for each file
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the number of bytes that DROID scans in order to return an identification
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a delay between identifying files using the throttle (to reduce the&nbsp;load on your
        network or servers).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       You will need to weigh up your requirements for accuracy, speed and what use you want to
      make of the profiling information, setting your preferences accordingly before you begin to
      profile your information.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="LeaveRunning" name="LeaveRunning">Can I set it up and just leave DROID running?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Yes. Although you need to ensure that DROID has the correct access permissions to profile
      the locations that you have identified. Also, it is good practice to pause and save your
      profiling at regular intervals, to ensure that if you experience an unexpected problem (such
      as power shortage or the area that DROID is running in is affected) you can pick up your
      profiling again without losing all your results so far.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is also possible to set up batch files or shell scripts to automate the process and
      produce reports when running DROID through the <a href="Command line control.html">command
      line</a>. You should speak to technical specialist in your organisation for more information
      about this.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="PerformanceImpact" name="PerformanceImpact">Will DROID 6 impact on the performance of
      my systems?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Yes, there will be some impact, but this depends on a number of factors. &nbsp;DROID does
      not typically&nbsp;exert a high load on the file systems and networks it is running over, but
      this will obviously depend on your particular environment and usages.
    </p>
    <p>
       DROID 6 has dynamic throttling (configurable only&nbsp;in the GUI), so if you want to limit
      the impact on your systems you can increase the amount of time that DROID pauses between
      identifying each file. Because it is dynamic, you can for example slow down the rate at which
      DROID works during the day, to reduce the load on your network, then increase its speed in
      the evening. Remember that the more you ask DROID to pause, the longer it will take to
      complete profiling.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="DiskSpace" name="DiskSpace">How much disk space do I need to run DROID?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID needs disk space in its working area to process <a href=
      "FAQ.html#StoreCopies">temporary files</a>, and to record the database of results it builds
      up as it profiles. &nbsp;Profiles can require up to a gigabyte per two million files
      processed.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="WhereLimits" name="WhereLimits">Are there any limitations to where DROID can
      profile?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       You will need to ensure that DROID 6 has the appropriate access permissions to scan the
      repositories that it is you have requested. DROID can only profile files held in file systems
      or systems which provide a file-system view of its files to your operating system (e.g. a
      network share). &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="StoreCopies" name="StoreCopies">Does DROID 6 store copies of the files that it is
      profiling?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID 6 creates temporary files when profiling inside archival files, such as zip, tar or
      gzip files. &nbsp;These are written out by default as ~tmp files in the <b>.droid6</b> tmp
      directory, unless the <a href="Startup configuration.html#TempFiles">temporary folder
      area</a> has been configured to be somewhere else. &nbsp;There are automatic cleanup
      processes to remove information from this directory when the temporary file is no longer
      needed, however on some occasions (such as if DROID stops unexpectedly), some files may not
      be deleted. It is good practice to check this location regularly and remove any ~tmp files
      that are no longer required by DROID. &nbsp;DROID&nbsp;will log a warning if it cannot delete
      a temporary file.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is not possible to say how much space is required for temporary files while processing,
      as this will depend on the size of your archival files and their contents. &nbsp;DROID also
      profiles more than one file at a time, so more than one archival file may be being processed
      simultaneously. &nbsp;It is prudent to ensure that you have enough space in your droid
      working area to handle decompressing several archival files at any one point in time.
      &nbsp;If processing very large file systems, we would recommend that at least
      10&nbsp;gigabytes of disk space should be reserved for temporary file processing, but you may
      require more or less depending on your files.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <b><a id="WhyStopped" name="WhyStopped">Why has DROID stopped profiling before
      completion?</a></b>
    </h3>
    <p>
       This may be for a number of reasons. DROID 6 has crash recovery built in, which means as
      long as DROID has sufficient warning that a file system has become unavailable (which it may
      not have in some instances, such as a power shortage) it will pause the current profile ready
      to be saved and / or resumed at a later date.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is good practice to pause and save your profiling at regular intervals, to ensure that if
      you experience an unexpected problem (such as power shortage or the area that DROID is
      running in is affected) you can pick up your profiling again without losing data.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="CantResume" name="CantResume">Why can&#39;t I resume a paused profile?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Because of the crash-recovery capability built in to DROID, it is important that any of the
      top level folders&nbsp;that are selected are not deleted, removed or renamed either during
      profiling (if the profile is paused) or before DROID has begun to profile them. This will
      cause the profile to pause and you will not be able to be resume it. &nbsp;This is because
      DROID interprets a missing top-level folder as a missing file system, and it automatically
      puts the profile into a pause mode to enable you to save your work and to resume when the
      file system becomes available again.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is best practice to select the highest folder possible when selecting the top-level
      folders&nbsp;that you intend to profile and ensure that these are not moved, deleted or
      renamed during or before profiling. &nbsp;If you do experience your profile stopping for this
      reason, you can still interrogate the data that you do have. &nbsp;You can also create a new
      profile that contains the remaining top-level items which were not profiled. &nbsp;Multiple
      profiles can be reported on and exported together, so you will achieve the same results.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="NotDoneFilter" name="NotDoneFilter">Why does filtering on a &#34;Not Done&#34; status give no
      results?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Files or folders which have not yet been processed have a Not Done status in DROID.
      &nbsp;These files and folders have not yet been recorded in the database, only in the
      specification of what to eventually profile. &nbsp;Filtering works by querying the underlying
      database in which DROID records its results, therefore filtering on the Not Done status
      returns no results, even if there are files and folders visible in the main view which have
      not yet been processed.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="FilterSpeed" name="FilterSpeed">Why does opening some filtered folders take a long
      time?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       When a filter is applied to a profile, the user interface has to do a lot of work
      determining the status of each file or folder in the opening folder. &nbsp;Folders with lots
      of direct files or other folders in them (i.e. many thousands) can take quite a long time to
      open. &nbsp;This does not affect the filtering speed for exporting or reporting, so if you
      are having problems opening a large folder with a filter, consider exporting the profile to a
      CSV file, or running a report over it, rather than trying to open it in the user interface.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="StartFailure" name="StartFailure">What can I do if DROID fails to start up?</a>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If DROID fails to start up, you may be running the wrong <a href=
        "FAQ.html#JavaVersion">version of Java</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can try moving, deleting or renaming your <b>.droid6</b> folder, as described below.
        &nbsp;DROID will recreate a new working folder with all the default files it needs when it
        starts up again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that your installed version of Java is accessible from where DROID is installed.
        &nbsp;From a command-line in your droid installation folder, type "java -version". &nbsp;If
        you don&#39;t see the Java version being displayed, you may have to configure the path to your
        Java installation. &nbsp;Please consult the installation instructions for Java for your
        operating system for details on how to do this.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>&nbsp;Deleting your .droid6 folder</b>
    </p>
    <p>
       By default, your <b>.droid6</b> folder is set to be created in your home directory. &nbsp;On
      Windows, this is often found at <font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\.droid6</font>,
      or <font face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">C:\Users\USERNAME\.droid6</font>.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;On UNIX systems, this may be found under <font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">/home/USERNAME/.droid6</font>
    </p>
    <p>
       If you are running DROID on a Mac or other Linux based system, please note that the
      <b>.droid6</b> folder will be in the same location but will be &#39;hidden&#39;. Note that Mac
      systems do not make hidden files easily accessible from your computer. You can delete the
      folder&nbsp;from your machine using the command line. &nbsp;Please refer to your operating
      system instructions for doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;(Please note: the location of the <b>.droid6</b> folder is <a href=
      "Startup configuration.html">configurable using a batch file or shell script</a>, and may
      have been set to a different location on your machine)
    </p>
    <p>
       By default, the <b>.droid6</b> folder contains any downloaded&nbsp;binary and container
      signature files, log files, settings, report definitions, and temporary working area,
      although some of these can be <a href="Startup configuration.html">configured to be in
      different locations</a>. Please make sure you no longer require any of this information
      before deleting. &nbsp;However, DROID will recreate all the default&nbsp;information it needs
      by default when it runs again, effectively resetting to a new installation.
