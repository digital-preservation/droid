       Results appear in your profile tab as soon as they are profiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have
      profiled any folders, then you can see the files and sub-folders inside them by clicking on
      the open folder icon to their left.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the right of each resource are columns
      containing <a href="Information collected by DROID.html">information</a> about each resource.

       You can sort the columns by clicking on the column header. &nbsp;Clicking once will sort in
      descending order, another click will sort in ascending order, and a third click will remove
      the sort. &nbsp;The sort will also group resources that can have resources inside them (e.g.
      folders or zip files) together, followed by the files, to keep similar resources together.

    <p>
       When you have a lot of results, it is useful to be able to filter them, in order to narrow
      down on the files or folders of particular interest. &nbsp;You can define a filter for your
      results by clicking the <img src="../Images/Filter small.png"> <font style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter &nbsp;</font>&nbsp;button, or by
      selecting the <b><font size="4">Filter / Edit Filter...</font></b> menu item. &nbsp;In the
      filter definition dialog, you can add one or more conditions that a file must meet in order
      to be visible in your profile, change whether your files must meet all the conditions you
      specify, or any of them, and set whether the filter is enabled or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <h3>
       <a id="AnyOrAll" name="AnyOrAll">Any or All</a>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All - files must meet all filter conditions specified in order to be visible in your
        profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any - files can meet any filter condition specified in order to be visible in your profile.

    <h3>
       <a id="FilterEnabled" name="FilterEnabled">Filter enabled</a>

    <p>
       This checkbox allows you to set whether your filter is enabled or not. &nbsp;When enabled,
      results in your profile will be filtered, when disabled your filter conditions will simply
      not apply (but their definition will remain). &nbsp;You can also enable or disable filters
      via the <b><font size="4">Filter / Filter on</font></b> menu item.

    <h3>
       <a id="AddingFilterConditions" name="AddingFilterConditions">Adding Filter Conditions</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       To specify a filter condition, you must fill out three items in a row in the filter table.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Field - the type of information&nbsp;you want to filter on,
      </li>
      <li>
        Operation - the type of comparison to make,
      </li>
      <li>
        Values - what to compare the value of the field&nbsp;to.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
       <a id="Fields" name="Fields">Fields</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
       Fields are the kind of&nbsp;information you want to filter on. Click on the first column of
      the filter condition table, on the drop down box that says "<b><font size="4">&lt;Please
      select...&gt;</font></b>". &nbsp;You can select from the following fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>File name</b> - the (case sensitive) name of a file or folder
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>File size</b> &nbsp;- the size of a file in bytes
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>File extension</b> - the (case sensitive) file name extension
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Last modified date</b> - the data a file or folder was last modified
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Resource type</b> - whether the resource is a folder, file or archival file (a file that
        contains other files - e.g. a zip file).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mime type</b> - the mime-type of a file
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>PUID</b> - the PRONOM Unique IDentifier of a file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Format name</b> - the name of a format identified by a PUID.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Identification method</b> - the method by which a file or archival file was identified.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Job status</b> - whether a file has been processed, or had an error when profiled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       For more information on these fields and the information contained in them, please see "<a
      href="Information collected by DROID.html">Information collected by DROID</a>". &nbsp;You can
      specify more than one filter condition on the same field. &nbsp;Notice that if you are
      filtering using the <a href="#AnyOrAll">All</a> method, this makes it possible to create
      filters which no file can meet&nbsp;(e.g. size &lt; 100 and size &gt; 100)!
    </p>
    <h4>
       <a id="Operation" name="Operation">Operation</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
       Once you have selected the field you want to filter on, you can specify what kind of
      comparison operation should be performed on it. &nbsp;The available operations vary by the
      type of field you have selected:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Numbers and Dates</b>: less than (<b>&lt;</b>), less or equal&nbsp;(<b>&lt;=</b>),
        equals (=), greater than (=), greater or equal (&gt;=), not equals (&lt;&gt;)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Text</b> <i>(case sensitive)</i>: equals (=), not equals (&lt;&gt;), starts with, ends
        with, contains, does not start with, does not end with, does not contain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sets</b>: some types of field can have one or more values. selected&nbsp;out of a
        defined set of values&nbsp;(PUID, Mime type, Identification method, Job status). &nbsp;To
        compare sets, you can specify that there are "any of" the values in the specified set, or
        "none of" the values in the specified set of values.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
       <a id="Values" name="Values">Values</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
       Like the operations, the values you provide depend on the type of <a href=
      "Explore the results.html#Fields">fields</a> you are filtering on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Numbers</b>: enter a positive whole number. &nbsp;Only digits can be entered - no
        decimal points, plus or minus signs are allowed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dates</b>: provide the day, month and year in the boxes provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Text</b>: enter your text into the box provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sets</b>: You cannot enter set values directly into the value area - you must select
        them using the <a href="#SetSelectionDialog">set selection dialog</a>. &nbsp;To bring up
        the dialog, click the <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;...
        &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button to the right of the value area. &nbsp;Once you have selected
        your values, a read-only representation of them will appear in the value area. &nbsp;You
        can always edit your sets by bringing up the set selection dialog again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
       <a id="SetSelectionDialog" name="SetSelectionDialog">Set selection dialog</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
       The set selection dialog lets you select one or more values from a list.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <img src="../Images/Filter option selection.PNG">
    </p>
    <p>
       On the left hand side of the dialog are all the available values to select. &nbsp;On the
      right hand side are the values you want to filter on. &nbsp;To add values to your selection,
      select the values you would like to add on the left hand side, and press the <b><font style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Add &gt; &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button
      between the two panes. &nbsp;You can select values individually, or you can hold down the
      SHIFT key to select a list of values. &nbsp;If you hold down the CTRL key, you can select or
      deselect multiple items individually. &nbsp;To remove values from your selection, highlight
      the values you want to remove on the right hand side, using the same techniques as adding,
      and press the <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; Remove
      &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you are happy with your selection, press the <b><font style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;OK &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button at the
      bottom of the dialog. &nbsp;Your selected values will be placed in the value box in the
      filter dialog. &nbsp;If you want to cancel any changes you have made, press the <b><font
      style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancel
      &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="RemovingFilterConditions" name="RemovingFilterConditions">Removing Filter
      Conditions</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       To remove a filter condition, simply click the <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;"
      size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button at the far right of the row.
      &nbsp;You cannot remove the final row in the filter table, which always shows "<b><font size=
      "4">&lt;Please select...&gt;</font></b>" in the field column, as this row enables you to add
      new filter conditions. &nbsp;Unless you actually specify a field, this row does not
      contribute to the filter specification.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Load and Save filters
    </h3>
    <p>
       If you have a filter you want to re-use, you can save filters to a file, and load them back
      from a previously saved file. &nbsp;Clicking on these buttons brings up a file selection
      dialog window.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="ApplyAndCancel" name="ApplyAndCancel">Apply and Cancel</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       If you are happy with your filter definition, press the <b><font style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button at the
      bottom of the screen. &nbsp;Your filter specification will be associated with your profile,
      and if you had enabled the filter, it will be applied to the profile immediately. &nbsp;If
      you press the <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancel
      &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button, all changes you have made to the filter will be discarded, and
      any previous filter will be restored as it was before you opened the filter dialog.
