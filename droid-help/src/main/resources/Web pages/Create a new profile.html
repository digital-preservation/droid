       A profile is the&nbsp;files and folders you want to find out about, and the results of
      profiling them. &nbsp;You can create profiles by clicking the &nbsp;<img height="16" width="16" src=
      "../Images/icons/New.png"> <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4"> &nbsp;New
      &nbsp;</font></b> &nbsp;button, or selecting the <b><font size="4"><i>File /
      New</i></font></b> menu item. DROID automatically creates a blank profile for you when it
      starts.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <img src="../Images/screenshots/Creating%20a%20new%20profile.png">&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       You can create as many profiles as you like. Each profile appears in its own&nbsp;tab,
      underneath the toolbar.You can&nbsp;<a href="Choose files and folders.html">choose files and
      folders</a> as soon as the tab appears using the <img height="16" width="16"  src="../Images/icons/Add.png"> <font
      style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Add &nbsp;</b></font> command,
      but it takes a few seconds&nbsp;for a new profile to be ready to <a href=
      "Running a profile.html">run</a>. &nbsp;By default, profiles are "Untitled" until they are <a
      href="Load and save profiles.html">saved</a> with a filename.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once a profile is created, its settings are fixed from the <a href=
      "Change preferences.html#Profile">Profile Defaults</a> specified in the preferences window.
