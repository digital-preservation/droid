    <p>
       DROID can export all open profiles (which are not currently running) to a CSV file. &nbsp;To
      export a profile, press the <img height="16" width="16"  src="../Images/icons/Export.png"> <b><font style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export
      &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button, or select the<b><font size="4"> File / Export
      all...</font></b> menu item. &nbsp;This will bring up the export dialog window:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <img src="../Images/screenshots/Export%20dialog.png">
    </p>
    <p>
       The profiles you have open are listed in the export window. &nbsp;If a profile is empty, or
      in the process of running, it will be greyed out. &nbsp;Select all the profiles you want to
      export into a single CSV file by checking the boxes next to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;If any of your
      profiles have active <a href="Explore the results.html">filters</a>, then the results will
      also be filtered. &nbsp;Each profile can have different filters defined and enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
       You can also select whether the export should produce one row per file, or one row per
      format. &nbsp;When exporting one row per file, each row in the CSV file will represent a
      single file, folder or archival file profiled with DROID. &nbsp;If exporting one row per
      format, each row in the CSV file will be a single format identificaiton made by DROID.
      &nbsp;Since a file can be identified as being more than one possible format, this option will
      produce CSV files with multiple rows for the same file (but with different identifications
      for it).
    </p>
    <p>
        The characters of the export will be encoded as UTF-8 by default. If you need to set this
    to the encoding used on your local machine instead, select 'Platform specific' instead.
    </p> 
    <p>
       When you are happy you want to export your profiles, press the <b><font style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export
      profiles...&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; button. &nbsp;This will bring up a standard file-save
      dialog, in which&nbsp;you can specify where you want your CSV file to be saved. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
       CSV File Columns
    </h2>
    <h3>
       ID
    </h3>
    <p>
       This is a unique number assigned to each file, folder or archival file processed by DROID.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <b>PARENT_ID</b>
    </h3>
    <p>
       This is the id of the archival file or folder in which this file is contained.
    </p>
    <h3>
       URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
    </h3>
    <p>
       This provides a standard, cross-platform way of describing where resources are located.
      &nbsp;URIs are described in more detail in "<a href=
      "Information collected by DROID.html#Location">Information collected by DROID</a>".
    </p>
    <h3>
       File path
    </h3>
    <p>
       The file system&nbsp;location of the resource being profiled, if the resource was directly
      in a file system. &nbsp;Some files are not inside a file system - for example, files inside a
      zip file. In this case, the file path will be blank, as there is no file path to the
      resource. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Please note that file paths are platform dependent (they are different on windows and unix).
      &nbsp;DROID will write out file paths for the system on which it is currently running.
      &nbsp;This means that if you profile files on a unix machine, then export the profiles on a
      windows machine, the file paths will be written out as if they were windows file paths, and
      vice versa.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Name
    </h3>
    <p>
       The file name of the resource being profiled.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Method" name="Method">Method</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       This field gives the method by which a resource identification has been made. &nbsp;DROID
      can recognise resources by several methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Extension</b> - the file format was identified only by its filename <a href=
        "#Extension">extension</a>. &nbsp;This method may not be very reliable, as the filename
        extension may be wrong. &nbsp;It is only used when DROID cannot identify a resource by
        another method, and cannot usually identify what the version of a file format is, only its
        broad type.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Signature</b> - the file format was identified by finding a file format signature inside
        the file itself. &nbsp;This method is more reliable than filename extensions, and can
        identify the precise version of a file format.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Container</b> - the file format was identified by finding embedded files and patterns
        within them. &nbsp;This method is as reliable as signature identifications, and can be more
        reliable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a id="Job status" name="Job status">Job status</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       This field gives the identification status of a resource. &nbsp;It can have several values:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Not done</b> - the resource has not yet been profiled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Done</b> - the resource was processed with no errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Access denied</b> - the operating system refused to give DROID read permissions to the
        resource.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Not found</b> - the resource was moved or deleted before DROID could read it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Error</b> - an error occurred while trying to profile a resource. &nbsp;For example, if
        DROID is prevented from reading a file due to the user not having read permissions to it,
        this will result in a profiling error for that file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a id="Size" name="Size">Size (bytes)</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The size in bytes of a file. &nbsp;Only files have a size - folders do not. &nbsp;However,
      note that some files can contain other&nbsp;files inside them, for example zip files.
      &nbsp;In this case, the zip file has a size (as it is a file), and so do the files inside it.
      &nbsp;The size reported in all cases is the uncompressed size of each file, as it would
      appear if extracted from the container file.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Type
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID categorises the files and folders it profiles as being one of three types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <img height="24" width="24"  src="../Images/icons/fileResourceType.png">
        &nbsp;File&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <img height="24" width="24"  src="../Images/icons/folderResourceType.png">
        &nbsp;Folder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <img height="24" width="24"  src="../Images/icons/containerResourceType.png"> &nbsp;Archival file&nbsp;(e.g. zip)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a id="Extension" name="Extension">Extension</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The filename extension of a file, which is the last part of a filename following a full
      stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only files have extensions, as they indicate the type of the file.
      &nbsp;Even if a folder has a full stop in its name, it will not be assigned an extension.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Last Modified" name="Last Modified">Last modified</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The date and time on which a resource was last modified. &nbsp;This is the only resource
      date-time available to DROID, as the Java 6 platform on which it runs will not report any
      others (e.g. creation date-time). &nbsp;More file system&nbsp;information will be available
      via the Java 7 platform, which is not yet available at the time of writing. &nbsp;This would
      also require DROID to be modified to take advantage of the new file system interfaces in Java
      7.
    </p>
    <h3>
       MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 hash
    </h3>
    <p>
       If you have enabled <a href="Change preferences.html#GenerateHash">hash generation</a> in
      the preferences, then this column will contain the MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 hash for each file and archival file
      processed. &nbsp;See "<a href="Detecting duplicate files.html">Detecting duplicate files</a>"
      for more information on hashes.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="PUID" name="PUID">PUID</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The&nbsp;PRONOM Unique IDentifier (PUID) identifies the precise file format of a profiled
      file. When a resource has been identified, it is assigned a PUID. &nbsp;&nbsp;A unique
      identifier exists for every file format that DROID can recognise, and these identifiers are
      maintained in the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom">PRONOM</a><img height="16" width="16"   src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;technical registry database, hosted at the UK
      National Archives.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Mime type" name="Mime type">Mime type</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The mime-type of an identified file format is a high level format identifier assigned by the
      <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">Internet Assigned Numbers</a><img height="16" width="16"   src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">. &nbsp;It is widely used in email and other internet
      protocols to identify the type of resource. &nbsp;Not all file formats identified by DROID
      have an assigned mime-type, and different <a href="#PUID">PUIDs</a> assigned by DROID can
      have the same mime-type
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Format" name="Format">Format</a> Name
    </h3>
    <p>
       The name of an identified&nbsp;file format, as listed in the <a href=
      "http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom">PRONOM</a><img height="16" width="16"   src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;technical registry against its <a href=
      "#PUID">PUID</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Version" name="Version">Format Version</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The version of an identified file format, as listed in the <a href=
      "http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom">PRONOM</a><img height="16" width="16"   src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;technical registry against its <a href=
      "#PUID">PUID</a>. &nbsp;Not all file formats have a defined version, so this field can be
      blank even when a file has a PUID.
