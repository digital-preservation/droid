       DROID 6 has many new features which improve the speed, accuracy and your exploration of its
      results. &nbsp;Behind the scenes, it introduces some new capabilities to allow signatures for
      new&nbsp;file formats to be developed more easily, and with greater power to match
      difficult&nbsp;file formats.

        A new&nbsp;binary signature recognition engine is approximately twice as fast as the old

    <ul>
      <li>
        Container signatures are a new kind of file format signature, to recognise file formats
        which contain other files inside themselves (for example, Microsoft Office 2007 files).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a name="BinarySyntax" id="BinarySyntax">Binary signature syntax</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The syntax of the signatures used by the binary signature engine has been enhanced, both in
      terms of readability and fundamental expressivity. In addition to existing syntax, it allows
      for text strings, case insensitive text strings and arbitrary sets of bytes. &nbsp;These
      features can be mixed together in ways&nbsp;which the previous engine cannot process.
      &nbsp;This makes it easier to create new signatures, and to understand existing ones.
      &nbsp;In some cases, several old signatures can be combined into one signature, which
      increases the speed of DROID.
    </p>
    <p>
       The new syntax will be documented in other technical documentation, and will not appear in
      signature files for some time until users of DROID&nbsp;have updated to the newer engine.
      &nbsp;Some of the new syntax can be seen in the container signature files, which do not have
      backward compatibility issues.
