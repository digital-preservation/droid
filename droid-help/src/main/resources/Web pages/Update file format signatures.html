       DROID can update its file format signatures using the <a href=
      "http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom">PRONOM</a><img height="16" width="16"   src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;technical registry service hosted at the National
      Archives. &nbsp;To manually update your file format signatures, select the <b><font size=
      "4">Tools / Check for signature updates...</font></b> menu item. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <img src="../Images/screenshots/Install%20signature.png">
    </p>
    <p>
       Either enter the file name and path of the signature file you want to install, or press the
      <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4"> &nbsp;Browse... &nbsp;</font></b>
      button to bring up a file selection dialog. &nbsp;If you check the "Use this signature file
      as default", it will become the default for new profiles. &nbsp;If not, the signature will be
      available to select in the preferences should you want to use it at some point in the future,
      but will not be used by default. &nbsp;When you have selected the file to install, press the
      <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4"> &nbsp;Install &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>
      button, or <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4"> &nbsp;Cancel
      &nbsp;</font></b> to exit the dialog making no changes.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is also possible for DROID to automatically check for and update its signatures on a
      regular schedule. &nbsp;This can be configured in the <a href=
      "Change preferences.html#Signature">preferences</a> section.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you have a <a href="Update file format signatures.html#BinarySigs">binary signature</a>
      file locally that you want to use, you can install this file in DROID using the <b><font
      size="4">Tools / Install signature file...</font></b> menu item. &nbsp;This will bring up a
      file open dialog from which you can select the signature file that you want DROID to use.
      &nbsp;Currently this feature cannot be used to install <a href=
      "Update file format signatures.html#ContainerSigs">container signatures</a>, only binary
      signature files.
    </p>
    <p>
       Alternatively, you can manually copy a binary or container signature file into your droid
      working area (which is by default located in a folder called <font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">".droid"</font>, underneath your home folder).
      &nbsp;For binary signature files, place them in the "<font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">signature_files</font>" sub-folder. &nbsp;For
      container signature files, place them in the "<font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">container_sigs</font>" sub folder. &nbsp;Note that
      container signature files have a number appended to them, which is the date on which they are
      updated, in the format year, month date. &nbsp;For example, the file "<font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">container-signature-20110114.xml</font>" is the
      container signature file last updated on January 14th, 2011.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="BinarySigs" name="BinarySigs">Binary signatures</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Most file formats have either "<a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic numbers</a>" <img height="16" width="16"   src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;embedded within them, or they have regular
      structures which always appear in files of that format. &nbsp;The binary signatures define
      what patterns to find in order to identify a file format. &nbsp;The signatures can specify
      simple sequences of bytes, alternate sequences, or several different possible bytes at the
      same position in the file. &nbsp;These patterns may be found at known positions (e.g. at the
      start or 20 bytes in from the end of the file), or they may appear at variable positions,
      either within a known range of possible positions, or anywhere in the file at all.
      &nbsp;Signatures can combine all of these features, sometimes more than one in the same
      signature. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Taking a very contrived example, a signature may specify that there are three bytes at the
      start of the file: 01, 02 and 03. &nbsp;Then 5 bytes on there is either 04 or 05. After that,
      somewhere between 10 and 1000 bytes on is either 06 07 08 09, or 10, 11, 12, 13.
      &nbsp;Finally, the bytes ff, ee, dd are found right at the end of the file.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="ContainerSigs" name="ContainerSigs">Container signatures</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Some file formats are actually collections of embedded files, each with their own
      formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Microsoft Office 2007 files are actually zip files, which
      contain various other files. &nbsp;Taken together, they define an Office 2007 file.
      &nbsp;Binary signatures are not very good at identifying files like this, as the contents of
      the embedded files are obscured by the containing format (in this case, zip). &nbsp;In order
      to provide more accurate identifications, DROID can open files which use either the ZIP
      format, or the OLE2 format, and look inside them to see what embedded files are present.
    </p>
    <p>
       Container signatures are just specifications of which files to look for inside the
      containing formats, and optionally, one or more <a href=
      "Update file format signatures.html#BinarySigs">binary signatures</a> to run against those
      files if they are found.
