       &nbsp;<b><a id="Duplicates" name="Duplicates"><font size="5">Duplicate files</font></a></b>
    </p>
    <p>
       It is very common to find that files are duplicated in different areas of your filing
      systems.&nbsp; Some estimates show&nbsp;that around 30% of all file storage consists of
      duplicate files. &nbsp;This can happen because many users save the same files from email
      attachments, or they take a backup copy of files while they are working on them, but don�t
      end up changing most of them.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       One method&nbsp;of duplicate detection is to use content hashes. If two files have the same
      hash value, then they are overwhelmingly likely to have identical content.&nbsp;The odds of
      two arbitrary files having the same hash value by accident are less than 1 in
      18,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is very, very low.&nbsp;DROID can generate content hashes
      for your files, but note that DROID will not locate files with the same hash value for you,
      only generate them in the first place. &nbsp;If you export your profiles to a CSV file and
      import them into software like Excel or Access, you can query for files which have the same
      hash.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Another method of locating duplicate files (without using hashes) is to search for folder
      names containing words like, �backup�, �temp� and �old�, as users frequently name folders or
      files with these words if they intend them to be temporary copies. Another, more time
      consuming method, is by examining the names of files and folders. If there are areas with
      very similar (or identical names), then you may have duplicate information within
      them.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, both of these methods can only give you an indication that there
      may be duplication and a high degree of manual review will still be required to assure
      yourself that the file contents are really duplicated.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       If you do find duplicate files, you must decide how to deal with them. Clearly you will need
      to keep at least one of them, but you will have to decide which, if any, can be safely
      removed.&nbsp; There are risks to digital continuity in deleting files, so you should take
      into account several considerations before deleting duplicates:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        not all users may have access to all copies of a duplicate file
      </li>
      <li>
        the duplicate files may have different metadata. For example, the location of a file in a
        filing structure can provide essential context. Or there may be important audit metadata
        showing that different people opened the different duplicates
      </li>
      <li>
        a duplicate file may provide context to the surrounding data it was stored next to. The
        loss of this context could render the meaning of the surrounding files unclear or
        unintelligible
      </li>
      <li>
        large areas of duplication may be for test or development environments, and therefore will
        be necessary for systems development.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       You can mitigate some of the risks related to loss of context by leaving shortcuts (or
      symbolic links in a UNIX file system) to the �master file� when you delete a duplicate.
    </p>

       <b><font size="5">What are hashes</font></b>
    </p>
    <p>
       Hashes are long numbers, often represented as <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> <img src=
      "../Images/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;text, which can be used as a signature to identify
      the content of a file. &nbsp;The hashes generated by DROID are called "<a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a>"<img src=
      "../Images/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;hashes, which are fairly fast to produce (relative
      to other hashing algorithms).
    </p>
    <p>
       MD5 hashes are useful to locate duplicates in the files you profile,&nbsp;and to match with
      common files which have published hash values. &nbsp;However, MD5 hashes are not resistant to
      malicious attack - an attacker can create files which have the same hash but with different
      content. &nbsp;The goal of hashing in DROID&nbsp;is not to provide a cryptographic assurance
      of uniqueness, only to locate likely duplicates and to&nbsp;link to forensic hash databases
      (most of which use MD5).
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       <b><a id="ForensicDatabases" name="ForensicDatabases"><font size="5">Forensic Hash
      Databases</font></a></b>
    </p>
    <p>
       Forensic hash databases are published databases of hash values for files which are widely
      found. &nbsp;These can allow you to detect whether the files in your systems are common, well
      known files (such as Windows system files), whether they contain known illegal content, and
      in some cases, malware such as viruses. &nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing which files are well known
      outside your organisation can support information policy and decision making.&nbsp; For
      example, you may discover that a lot of storage space is being taken up with multiple copies
      of files which are easily replaced from install CDs. Files which are not well known probably
      contain unique content, and would be hard to replace if deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are a variety of content hash databases available. One such database is:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/">National Software Reference Library</a> <img src=
        "../Images/Icon_External_Link.png">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Note that DROID does not link your files to these hash databases. It merely generates a
      compatible hash for each of your files, which you can then use to link with them. You will
      require additional technical assistance to perform these links.
