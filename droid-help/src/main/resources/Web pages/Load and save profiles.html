       DROID can open and save profiles to a file with a <b>.droid</b> filename extension.
      &nbsp;Note that DROID 6 cannot open profiles created by earlier versions of DROID. &nbsp;

       To open a saved profile, press the <img height="16" width="16"  src="../Images/icons/Open%20file.png">&nbsp;<b><font
      style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Open &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button,
      or select the <b><font size="4">File / Open</font></b> menu item. &nbsp;A standard file
      open&nbsp;selection dialog will appear. &nbsp;Navigate to the droid profile you want to open,
      and press the <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;OK
      &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button. <b><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></b>The profile will open in a
      new tab. &nbsp;If it is a large profile (containing hundreds of thousands of files and
      folders), it may take a few minutes to open. &nbsp;A progress bar at the bottom of the screen
      shows how much of the profile has been opened so far.

       To save a profile, press the <img height="16" width="16"  src="../Images/icons/Save.png"> <b><font style=

      select the <b><font size="4">File /&nbsp;Save</font></b> menu item. &nbsp;If your profile has
      never been saved before, a standard file save dialog will appear, and you can choose where to
      save the file and what name it has. <b><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></b>If your profile has
      been saved before, it will be saved to the place it was opened from, and no file save dialog
      will appear. &nbsp;It it is a large profile (containing hundreds of thousands of files and
      folders), it may take a few minutes to save. &nbsp;&nbsp;A progress bar at the bottom of the
      screen shows how much of the profile has been saved so far.
    </p>
    <p>
       To save an existing profile to another file, select the <b><font size="4">File /&nbsp;Save
      As...</font></b> menu item. &nbsp;This will always bring up a file save dialog, allowing you
      to choose a different file to save to.&nbsp;

    <p>
       Profile files are actually&nbsp;zip files, which contain some XML files describing the
      profile, and a database containing any results of profiling so far. &nbsp;DROID currently
      uses the <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache Derby</a><img height="16" width="16"  src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">&nbsp;database, version 10.7, which can be opened using
      various third-party tools, such as <a href="http://www.dbvis.com/">DB Visualizer</a><img height="16" width="16"  src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">. &nbsp;The username to connect to a droid database is
      <b>droid_user</b>, and the password is the same as the username. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       It is possible to manually edit the profile settings contained within the&nbsp;<font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono"><i>profile.xml</i></font> file. &nbsp;However, it is
      <b>not recommended</b> that you do this, as changing settings within a profile may mean that
      inconsistent results are returned (if the profile is paused and there are remaining results
      to process), or may&nbsp;even cause DROID to crash if the settings conflict with the profile
      state. &nbsp;In particular you must not change which signatures are used by a profile.
      &nbsp;We cannot guarantee that other settings are safe to change. &nbsp;Changing this file is
      entirely at your own risk.
