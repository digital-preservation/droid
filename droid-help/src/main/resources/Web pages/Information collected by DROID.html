       DROID categorises the files and folders it profiles as being one of three types:

    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>Files</b> have format identifications, but do not have other files or folders inside
      them. <b>Folders</b> do not have any format identifications or sizes, but can contain other
      folders, files and archival files inside them. <b>Archival files</b> are like folders, in
      that they can contain other folders, files and archival files inside them, but they are also
      files, so they have format identifications and a file size. In this version, DROID can look
      inside zip, tar and gzip archival files. &nbsp;Archival files may have other archival files
      nested inside them. &nbsp;DROID will also profile inside these, and in any further nested
      archival files.
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;

    <table cellpadding="8" bgcolor="#eeeeee" border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

    <p>
       The name of a file, folder or archival file is its name, independent of its location on a
      disk or inside an archival file. The file name extension (if any) is part of its name. DROID
      treats all filenames as <a href=
      "Information collected by DROID.html#CaseSensitive">case-sensitive</a>. For example,
      &#39;MYDOCUMENT.DOC&#39; and &#39;mydocument.doc&#39; are regarded as different file names.

    <p>
       File extensions are a convention to indicate the broad type of a file (or archival file) by
      appending a short string to a file name, separated by a full stop. &nbsp;On Microsoft
      Windows, the filename extension is used to indicate to the operating system what application
      to run when double-clicking on the file. &nbsp;Other operating systems do not use the
      filename extension to determine which application to use. &nbsp;However, filename extensions
      have become a de-facto standard for indicating the broad type of a file format, and are
      usually appended to filenames, even when a file is created on other platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
       DROID extracts the file extension (if any) from a file name or archival file name and stores
      it separately, to facilitate reporting, sorting and filtering on the extension alone.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       File names which begin with a full stop and have no other full stops in them are not
      regarded as having an extension. For example, a file called &#39;.myfile&#39; has a filename of
      &#39;.myfile&#39; and a blank extension, whereas &#39;.myfile.doc&#39; has a file name of &#39;.myfile.doc&#39; and
      an extension of &#39;.doc&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because file names starting with a full stop are
      hidden files in unix&nbsp;file systems, and also because it is not likely that a file name
      would be entirely composed of a file extension, with no name before it.
    </p>
    <p>
       DROID treats file extensions as <a href=
      "Information collected by DROID.html#CaseSensitive">case sensitive</a>. However, it converts
      all file extensions to lower-case to facilitate filtering and reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <table cellpadding="8" bgcolor="#eeeeee" border="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td align="center" width="95%">
          <img height="16" width="16"  src="../Images/icons/severity_WARN.png"> &nbsp;<b><a id="ExtensionMismatch" name=
          "ExtensionMismatch"><font size="5">File name extension mismatch warning</font></a></b>

    </table>
    <p>
       Sometimes file extensions are incorrect for the type of the file, or are missing where there
      should be one. If DROID detects that the file extension for a file name does not match the
      formats it has identified, it will issue a file extension mismatch warning. For example, if a
      file called &#39;myfile.doc&#39; is identified as a spreadsheet, then a file extension mismatch
      warning will be issued.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the graphical user interface, extension mismatch warnings appear as a warning symbol <img height="16" width="16" src="../Images/icons/severity_WARN.png">&nbsp;against the file extension itself. &nbsp;When
      exported to a CSV file, it will appear as a True or False value&nbsp;in its own column.

       DROID records the location of every file and folder it profiles. It records location in two
      ways, using a file <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme">Uniform Resource
      Indicator</a> (URI) <img height="16" width="16"   src="../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">, and a file path where one
      exists. Like file names and extensions, DROID treats file paths and URIs as case sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are two ways of recording location because not all files and folders have a file path,
      although this is the usual method of identifying location in a file system. Any file, folder
      or archival file which is inside another archival file does not have a defined file path, as
      it is inside the archival file, not directly in the file system.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, if we have:
    </p>
    <ol type="1" start="1">
      <li>
        a folder called &#39;Folder&#39; on the &#39;C:\&#39; drive of a Windows computer
      </li>
      <li>
        a file called &#39;Document.doc&#39; inside &#39;Folder&#39;,
      </li>
      <li>
        an archival file called &#39;Archive.zip&#39; inside &#39;Folder&#39;
      </li>
      <li>
        a spreadsheet called &#39;Spreadsheet.xls&#39; inside &#39;Archive.zip&#39;
      </li>
      <li>
        a folder called &#39;Another folder&#39; inside &#39;Archive.zip&#39;
      </li>
      <li>
        a picture called &#39;Large picture.jpg&#39; inside &#39;Another folder&#39;
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       Then we have the following file paths and URIs:

       Only files, archival files or folders which are directly accessible in the file system have
      a file path. Those files and folders which are inside the zip file do not have a file path,
      but do have a URI, which tells you that they are inside the zip file, where they can be found
      in it, and where the zip file they are inside is to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
       The prefixes of a URI tell you what sort of resource is being described by the URI, and the
      exclamation marks indicate where one type of resource is contained by another. For example,
      for &#39;Spreadsheet.xls&#39;, we can see that there is a file, C:/Folder/Archive.zip, with the
      prefix <font color="#0000ff">file:/</font>. The exclamation mark (<font color=
      "#ff0000">!</font>) tells us that the spreadsheet is contained by the Archive.zip file, and
      the first prefix <font color="#800080">zip:/</font> tells us the type of the containment is a
      zip file. Note that spaces in URIs are encoded by &#39;<font color="#808080">%20</font>&#39;, and
      folder separators are always forward slashes. &nbsp;If zip files are contained inside zip
      files, inside zip files, more prefixes and exclamation marks are added as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
       URIs mean that all resources profiled by DROID&nbsp;have a unique reference which tells you
      where the resource is, even if it is inside an archival file, inside another archival file,
      and so on. &nbsp;This is something that file paths cannot do. &nbsp;However, both are
      provided, as working with file paths is easier, where they exist for a resource.

       The size of a file or archival file is recorded as the number of bytes used by the file.
      Files can have a size of zero (no content, just a record in the file system). Folders do not
      have a size.
    </p>
    <p>
       The size of an archival file is the size of the archival file itself, not the sum of the
      sizes of its contents. For example, zip files compress their contents, so the sum of the
      sizes of the files inside a zip file will be bigger than the size of the archival file
      itself.

       Most files, folders and archival files record the date and time on which they were last
      modified. This is not the same as the date a file was originally created, or the date on
      which a file was last read. Unfortunately, due to limitations in Java 6, DROID can only
      acquire the last modified date, even though the other dates may be present on the file
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is possible that not every file, folder or archival file will have a last modified date.
      For example, in some cases, resources inside archival files may not record this date.
    </p>
    <p>
       It is important to note that last-modified dates can be changed when files are copied from
      one server to another, so this date may not reflect the last date a user actively modified
      the content of a file. Also, the content of a file (the data within it) may actually be older
      than the file itself if a file was copied, or simply typed up manually from an older piece
      of content.
    </p>
    <p>
       Some files may have noticeably inaccurate dates, e.g. 1 Jan 1970. In this case, the files
      will be newer than indicated. This error will likely be caused by the battery failing on the
      internal clock of the computer from which the document was uploaded, or some other error
      which caused the date to be set incorrectly. &nbsp;

       DROID attempts to identify the format of files, including archival files, but not folders.
      The number of identifications DROID records for a file can vary. It can have
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <img height="16" width="16"  src="../Images/icons/format_count_ZERO.png"> &nbsp;zero, if DROID can&#39;t identify a
        format at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img height="16" width="16"  src="../Images/icons/format_count_ONE.png"> &nbsp;one, if it is unambiguously
        identified as a single format.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u><b><font color="#0000ff">(2)</font></b></u> &nbsp;more than one, if DROID can&#39;t
        unambiguously decide what format it is in.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       In the user interface, the number in brackets indicates the number of possible format
      identifications made. &nbsp;Clicking on the link will bring up a window showing all the
      identifications in a table. &nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple possible identifications can happen for
      three reasons.
    </p>
    <ol type="1" start="1">
      <li>
        A format is identified purely on the basis of its file extension, so multiple versions of a
        file format may match the same extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        A format has several versions which are very similar and hard for DROID to distinguish
        between, so DROID will simply report all the possible versions.
      </li>
      <li>
        A file may contain patterns, purely by chance, which appear in more than one file
        format.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ol>

       When DROID identifies a file format, it records four pieces of information:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        format name
      </li>
      <li>
        format version
      </li>
      <li>
        PRONOM Unique Identifier (PUID)
      </li>
      <li>
        mime-type.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The format name is simply a human-readable name given to a file format or family of file
      formats, for example, &#39;Microsoft Word&#39;. The format version is the version of the format, for
      example &#39;97-2003&#39;. The PUID is a globally unique, persistent identifier for a file format and
      version, assigned by the National Archives through its <a href=
      "http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom">PRONOM file format registry</a><img height="16" width="16"   src=
      "../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">. For example, the PUID for the &#39;Microsoft Word 97-2003&#39;
      file format is &#39;fmt/40&#39;.
    </p>
    <p>
       PUIDs are guaranteed never to change, although new PUIDs may be defined. Clicking on a PUID
      in DROID will take you to the relevant page for that file format on the National Archives
      PRONOM website.&nbsp; The website will also help you with some file format names that you may
      be unfamiliar with. In particular, you may see files identified as 'OLE2 Compound Document
      Format' (PUID fmt/111) which you can interpret as 'Microsoft Office generic'&nbsp;. In these
      cases, the file is a Microsoft Office file which DROID could not identify any more closely,
      but the file extension may indicate more precisely.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Finally, the mime-type is another scheme for identifying broad types of files in use on the
      internet. They are assigned by a body called the <a href=
      "http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a><img height="16" width="16"
      src="../Images/icons/Icon_External_Link.png">.&nbsp; Mime-types are quite broad classifications, so
      many different file formats will have the same mime-type. For example, the mime-type for
      &#39;fmt/40&#39; is &#39;application/msword&#39; which is shared by all other binary Microsoft Word
      formats.

    <p>
       DROID has three different methods of identifying file formats:
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        extension
      </li>
      <li>
        signature
      </li>
      <li>
        container.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       An &#39;<b>extension</b>&#39; identification means that a format was identified purely on the basis
      of its file extension. Such an identification may not be reliable, as files can be named in
      any way, and extensions do not identify formats down to the version level, so such
      identifications can be quite broad, and may result in multiple identifications.
    </p>
    <p>
       A &#39;<b>signature</b>&#39; identification means that a format was identified by finding signature
      patterns inside the file which are known to occur in particular file formats and versions.
      This method is quite reliable, as it is fairly unlikely that by chance a file will happen to
      have a pattern belonging to a different file format than its own.
    </p>
    <p>
       A &#39;<b>container</b>&#39; identification means that a format was identified by finding embedded
      files (possibly with signatures of their own) inside the main file. For example, Microsoft
      Office 2007&nbsp;word processing files are actually zip files containing xml files, images or
      other resources used in the document. A container identification would identify the main file
      as a Microsoft Office 2007 file, not a zip file. This method is very reliable, as not only
      does the broad type of container have to be identified (e.g. zip), but the zip file must then
      be opened, and files inside scanned for further identifications to be made. &nbsp;The
      original zip identification is removed, and replaced by the Office 2007 identification, on
      the basis of the files discovered within it.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note that this is not the same as profiling files inside Archival files, even though
      container-format files may be based on an archival format like zip. &nbsp;A container-format
      is a single file format, whose specification relies on specific files being&nbsp;inside it to
      define the overarching format. An archival file format is a format whose only purpose is to
      contain other files, and the particular files inside it has no effect on its identification
      as an&nbsp;archival format.

    <p>
       DROID can optionally generate a content hash of the contents of each file and archival file,
      using the industry standard &#39;MD5&#39; &#39;SHA1&#39; or &#39;SHA256&#39; algorithms. A content hash is a short signature&nbsp;that
      can be used to identify the content of the file. It is extremely unlikely that two different
      files will have the same content hash (although this is a remote possibility).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Content hashes can be used to detect files with duplicate content, or can be linked to
      forensic hash databases to find or exclude files which are widely used (and therefore not
      unique to your organisation) or which contain illegal content. &nbsp;See "<a href=
      "Detecting duplicate files.html">Detecting duplicate files</a>" for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
       Content hashing is turned off by default, as producing a hash requires reading the entire
      file, which will slow down DROID significantly.&nbsp;

       All text collected by DROID is treated case sensitively, so upper case and lower case text

      must either be entirely case sensitive, or entirely case insensitive. &nbsp;DROID requires
      some fields in its database to be case sensitive in order to operate properly, which means we
      cannot make only some information case insensitive, even where it&nbsp;might be more useful
