       There are some <a href="Startup configuration.html#Settings">settings</a> which
      DROID&nbsp;needs to be told at the point it&nbsp;starts up. &nbsp;These either relate to how
      Java is started in the first place, or to fundamental settings which DROID&nbsp;needs to know
      before it can do anything else. &nbsp;You can configure these settings in several ways, by <a
      href="Startup configuration.html#EditScripts">editing the startup scripts</a>, or by <a href=
      "Startup configuration.html#EnvironmentVars">setting system environment variables</a>.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;If any of the settings are not configured at all, they have defaults in each
      case.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="EditScripts" id="EditScripts">Editing startup scripts</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       There are two startup scripts which can be used to run DROID:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <font face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">droid.bat</font> on Windows
      </li>
      <li>
        <font face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">droid.sh</font> on Mac or Linux
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Each of these files is a simple text file, which has documented sections to configure each
      of the settings near the start of the file. &nbsp;Settings provided by the scripts&nbsp;will
      override any system environment variables you have set in the system as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note: be very careful if you edit the Mac or Linux startup scripts on Microsoft Windows
      systems, as this will often add Windows-specific line-endings to the file which may prevent
      it from working correctly on Mac or Linux systems. &nbsp;Some text editors let you specify
      the type of line-ending to write out.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="EnvironmentVars" id="EnvironmentVars">System environment variables</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID will attempt to pick up settings from system environment variables if they are not
      provided by a startup script. To configure system environment variables, please see the
      documentation for your operating system. &nbsp;&nbsp;The environment variables to use are
      documented against each of the settings below.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="Settings" id="Settings">Settings</a>

    <h3>
       <a name="MaxMemory" id="MaxMemory">Maximum memory to use</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Java programs can only use as much memory as the&nbsp;Java Runtime Environment sets aside
      for them. &nbsp;By default, this value is often quite low. &nbsp;We recommend that DROID runs
      with up to 512Mb of memory potentially available, which is the default when DROID runs if no
      further configuration is done. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       This is the only setting which will only take effect if DROID is run using the startup
      scripts. &nbsp;This is because it is a setting Java itself needs to know, before DROID is
      even run. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Default value (running through scripts and the DROID.exe file): <b><font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">512Mb</font></b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment variable: <i><b><font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">droidMemory</font></b></i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a name="UserSettings" id="UserSettings">User settings folder</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The user settings folder is where DROID stores user settings, including preferences, report
      definitions, filter definitions and file format signatures. &nbsp;If not otherwise
      configured, all the other folders and files configurable below are also stored under this
      folder.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Default value: a folder called "<b><font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">.droid6</font></b>" directly under the user's home
        directory,
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment variable: <i><b><font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">droidUserDir</font></b></i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a name="TempFiles" id="TempFiles">Temporary files folder</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The temporary files folder is where DROID creates and deletes temporary files required
      during processing. &nbsp;Two sub-folders are created underneath this folder:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>/tmp</b> - for decompressing archival files to be further processed, and any other
        temporary files required. &nbsp;These are deleted when no longer required during
        processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>/profiles</b> - to store temporary copies of profiles DROID currently has open.
        &nbsp;Each temporary profile is deleted when it is closed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       Normally there should be no files left in these areas after closing DROID down, but in case
      of any problems, any files in these areas can be safely deleted if DROID is not
      running.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Default value: the droid user settings folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment variable:<i><b><font face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">
        droidTempDir</font></b></i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a name="LogFolder" id="LogFolder">Logging folder</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The logging folder is where DROID writes its log files out during operation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Default value: a folder called "<b><font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">logs</font></b>" under the droid user settings
        folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment variable:<i><b><font face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">
        droidLogDir</font></b></i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a name="LogConfig" id="LogConfig">Log configuration</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID uses a logging system called <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</a> <img
      src="../Images/Icon_External_Link.png">. &nbsp;You can configure different log settings by
      providing the path to a log configuration file, or by editing the settings in the default log
      configuration file.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Default value: a file called "<b><font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">log4j.properties</font></b>" under the droid user
        settings folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment variable:<i><b><font face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">
        log4j.configuration</font></b></i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       <a name="LogLevel" id="LogLevel">Console log level</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       DROID&nbsp;logs events to the console by default at an INFO&nbsp;level. &nbsp;If
      DROID&nbsp;is running in quiet mode from the command line, then this property is overridden
      to be at an ERROR&nbsp;level. &nbsp;You can configure the default log level to the console
      using this property in the start up scripts. Valid logging levels, from most verbose to least
      verbose,&nbsp;are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Default value: INFO
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment variable: <i><b>consoleLogThreshold</b></i>
      </li>
