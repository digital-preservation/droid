       DROID can create a variety of reports containing statistics about the files and folders
      in&nbsp;your profiles, and save the report as several different kinds of file.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="SelectProfiles" id="SelectProfiles">Selecting profiles to report on</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       To create a summary report of one or more profiles, press the <img height="24" width="24" src=
      "../Images/icons/Report.png">&nbsp;<font size="4" style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Report &nbsp;</b></font> &nbsp;button,
      or&nbsp;select the <b><font size="4">Report / Generate Report</font></b> menu option.
      &nbsp;This will bring up the profile selection dialog, which allows you to select which
      profiles to report on. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <img src="../Images/screenshots/Select%20profiles%20to%20report.png">
    </p>
    <p>
       If a selected profile has an active filter, this filter will be used when generating the
      report. &nbsp;So you can produce different reports on the same profiles, by using different
      filters. &nbsp;For example, you could filter out all files which are very large, giving you
      averages which are closer to the mean values normally encountered. Or you could filter out
      everything except document formats, letting you produce statistical reports on document types
      only.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="AvailableReports" id="AvailableReports">Available reports</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Once you have selected some profiles to report on, select which report you wish to generate.
      &nbsp;DROID ships with eleven pre-defined reports:

       In addition, some reports have special output formats defined. &nbsp;As shipped, DROID 6
      includes a PLANETS XML export option for the Comprehensive Breakdown report. &nbsp;All
      reports are generated from the DROID&nbsp;Report XML, so you can use this format to transform
      into any other formats you require, using XSLT technology. &nbsp;All report definitions, and
      any associated transforms are located in the report_definitions sub-folder underneath your <a
