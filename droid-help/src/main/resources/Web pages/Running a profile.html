    <h2>
       <img src="../Images/Play.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="Running" name="Running">Running</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
       You can start profiling files or folders using the <img src="../Images/Play small.png">
      <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Start &nbsp;</font></b>
      <b><font style=" background-color: #ffffff;" size="3">&nbsp;</font></b><font style=
      " background-color: #ffffff;" size="3">button, or by selecting the</font> <b><font style=
      " background-color: #ffffff;" size="4"><i>Run / Start Identification</i></font></b> <font
      style=" background-color: #ffffff;" size="3">menu item. &nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <img src="../Images/Profile running.PNG">
    </p>
    <p>
       As files and folders are identified, they are added to the profile, and you can see all
      the&nbsp;results obtained so far. If you expand a folder, it will show all the files and
      folders found so far. &nbsp;If you happen to open the folder that is being profiled at that
      time, you will see its child files and sub-folders appearing under it.
    </p>
    <p>
       Once you have started a profile running, you cannot <a href=
      "Choose files and folders.html">choose</a> any further files or folders in it. The
      specification of which files and folders to process in your profile&nbsp;becomes fixed at the
      point it first begins running. &nbsp;If you want to subsequently profile other files or
      folders, then you can do this in a <a href="Create a new profile.html">new&nbsp;profile</a>.
      &nbsp;Results held in multiple profiles can be&nbsp;<a href=
      "Exporting profiles.html">exported</a> and <a href="Summary reporting.html">reported</a> on
      together.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Progress" name="Progress">Progress</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       When your profile first starts running, it&nbsp;counts all the files and folders in your
      profile, including those in sub-folders. &nbsp;Once it has counted them, a progress bar will
      show how much work has been completed, and how much more there is to do. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       The progress bar&nbsp;only gives an&nbsp;<i>estimate</i> of progress. &nbsp;Files which
      exist&nbsp;inside other files (e.g. zip files) are not accounted for, and in any case, files
      can be added or removed&nbsp;from your file system while your profile is still running.
      &nbsp;In most cases, the progress bar gives a fairly good&nbsp;indication of the amount of
      work remaining to be done. &nbsp;The current file being analysed is also displayed, so even
      if the progress bar doesn't seem to be moving, you can see that it is still profiling.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Throttling" name="Throttling">Throttling back</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       You can control how quickly or slowly DROID processes the files in your profile, and this
      can be done at any time, whether your profile is running or not. &nbsp;This can take the load
      off your computer, network or disks if running&nbsp;it would impact you, or other users.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;By default, DROID works as quickly as it can, but you can tell DROID to delay for
      a short&nbsp;amount of time between each file it processes.
    </p>
    <p>
       To slow down or speed up DROID, use the slider control at the bottom right of the main
      window. &nbsp;When the slider is at the far left of the control, DROID will work as fast as
      it can (a delay of zero). &nbsp;When the slider is at the far right, DROID will wait for one
      second between processing each file. &nbsp;Even very small delays can reduce the load on
      networks and file servers, so the normal useful range for throttling is usually between zero
      and a hundred milliseconds.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Restrictions" name="Restrictions">Restrictions while profiling</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       While your profile&nbsp;is running, its&nbsp;filter cannot be enabled, and you cannot save
      it.&nbsp;If you had enabled a&nbsp;filter previously, it will be&nbsp;automatically disabled
      when your profile is&nbsp;started. Disabling a filter doesn't get rid of it - it just turns
      it off temporarily. &nbsp;You can turn it on again when the profile is finished, or paused.
    </p>
    <p>
       In addition, you cannot run any <a href="Summary reporting.html">reports</a> or <a href=
      "Exporting profiles.html">export</a> a profile while it is running. &nbsp;You can report and
      export other profiles which are not running.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you want to do any of the above tasks&nbsp;while a profile is running, you can
      temporarily <a href="#Pausing">pause</a> it, carry out the task, and then resume profiling
      later.
    </p>
    <h2>
       <img src="../Images/Pause.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="Pausing" name="Pausing">Pausing</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
       You can pause your profile at any time by pressing the <img src="../Images/Pause small.png">
      <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause
      &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;button, or by selecting the <b><font size="4"><i>Run / Pause
      identification</i></font></b> menu item.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <img src="../Images/Profile paused.PNG">
    </p>
    <p>
       The <a href="#Progress">progress</a> bar will freeze at whatever point it reached,
      and&nbsp;you will see no further messages about files being analysed in the status bar. Your
      profile may not pause straight away, as there may be a few outstanding items to be processed
      in its work queue, particularly if it is in the middle of uncompressing a large archival
      file. &nbsp;Once paused, there are no <a href="#Restrictions">restrictions</a> on what you
      can do with your profile&nbsp;(except that you cannot <a href=
      "Choose files and folders.html">choose</a> further&nbsp;files or folders once you have
      started profiling).
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a id="Resuming" name="Resuming">Resuming</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       You can resume profiling by simple&nbsp;<a href="#Running">running</a> it&nbsp;again, using
      the <img src="../Images/Play small.png"> <b><font style=" background-color: #c0c0c0;" size=
      "4">&nbsp;&nbsp;Start &nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;command. &nbsp;Profiling will pick up running
      from the point it left off, leaving all results so far&nbsp;intact. You can also <a href=
      "Load and save profiles.html">save</a> a paused profile, and then&nbsp;<a href=
      "Load and save profiles.html">open</a> and resume it at a later date. &nbsp;If the files
      where&nbsp;your profile was last paused are now different, DROID will attempt to resume by
      locating the nearest place it can successfully&nbsp;re-start from.
