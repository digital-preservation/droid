This has a large effect on the performance\n                    of DROID, and a smaller effect on the accuracy of its identifications. Almost all patterns which identify the format of files are found fairly close to\n                    the start or end of the file. By default, this setting is 65536 bytes (64KB).  You can\n                    make it smaller, and DROID's performance will increase, but the accuracy of identifications\n                    may go down.  Alternatively, you can make it bigger, and the performance of DROID will\n                    go down, and the identification accuracy may go up.

If you do have files which are not being identified, you can increase this value, or set it\n                    to -1, to see if this has any effect on identification accuracy.

For example, the filecontainer-signature-20110114.xmlis the\n                    container signature file last updated on January 14th, 2011.Update binary signaturesMost file formats have eithermagic numbersembedded within them, or they have regular\n                    structures which always appear in files of that format. The binary signatures define\n                    what patterns to find in order to identify a file format. The signatures can specify\n                    simple sequences of bytes, alternate sequences, or several different possible bytes at the\n                    same position in the file. These patterns may be found at known positions (e.g. at the\n                    start or 20 bytes in from the end of the file), or they may appear at variable positions,\n                    either within a known range of possible positions, or anywhere in the file at all.\n                    Signatures can combine all of these features, sometimes more than one in the same\n                    signature.Taking a very contrived example, a signature may specify that there are three bytes at the\n                    start of the file: 01, 02 and 03. Then 5 bytes on there is either 04 or 05.

    "title": "Detecting duplicate files",
    "url": "configuration.html#detecting-duplicate-files",
    "content": "It is very common to find that files are duplicated in different areas of your filing\n                    systems.  Some estimates show that around 30% of all file storage consists of\n                    duplicate files. This can happen because many users save the same files from email\n                    attachments, or they take a backup copy of files while they are working on them, but don't\n                    end up changing most of them. One method of duplicate detection is to use content hashes. If two files have the same\n                    hash value, then they are overwhelmingly likely to have identical content. The odds of\n                    two arbitrary files having the same hash value by accident are less than 1 in\n                    18,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is very, very low (these odds are for MD5, with SHA1, and then SHA256\n                    the odds become orders of magnitude lower still). DROID can generate content hashes\n                    for your files, but note that DROID will not locate files with the same hash value for you,\n                    only generate them in the first place. If you export your profiles to a CSV file and\n                    import them into software like Excel or Access, you can query for files which have the same\n                    hash. Another method of locating duplicate files (without using hashes) is to search for folder\n                    names containing words like, 'backup', 'temp' and 'old', as users frequently name folders or\n                    files with these words if they intend them to be temporary copies. Another, more time\n                    consuming method, is by examining the names of files and folders. If there are areas with\n                    very similar (or identical names), then you may have duplicate information within\n                    them. However, both of these methods can only give you an indication that there\n                    may be duplication and a high degree of manual review will still be required to assure\n                    yourself that the file contents are really duplicated. If you do find duplicate files, you must decide how to deal with them. Clearly you will need\n                    to keep at least one of them, but you will have to decide which, if any, can be safely\n                    removed.  There are risks to digital continuity in deleting files, so you should take\n                    into account several considerations before deleting duplicates: not all users may have access to all copies of a duplicate filethe duplicate files may have different metadata. For example, the location of a file in a\n                        filing structure can provide essential context. Or there may be important audit metadata\n                        showing that different people opened the different duplicatesa duplicate file may provide context to the surrounding data it was stored next to. The\n                        loss of this context could render the meaning of the surrounding files unclear or\n                        unintelligiblelarge areas of duplication may be for test or development environments, and therefore will\n                        be necessary for systems development. You can mitigate some of the risks related to loss of context by leaving shortcuts (or\n                    symbolic links in a UNIX file system) to the 'master file' when you delete a duplicate."

Hashes are useful to locate duplicates in the files you profile, and to match with\n                    common files which have published hash values. However, MD5 hashes are not resistant to\n                    malicious attack - an attacker can create files which have the same hash but with different\n                    content. The goal of hashing in DROID is not to provide a cryptographic assurance\n                    of uniqueness, only to locate likely duplicates and to link to forensic hash databases\n                    (most of which use MD5).

Other operating systems do not use the filename extension to determine which application to use.\n                    However, filename extensions have become a de-facto standard for indicating the broad type of a file format, and are usually appended to filenames, even when a file is created on other platforms. DROID extracts the file extension (if any) from a file name or archival file name and stores it separately, to facilitate reporting, sorting and filtering on the extension alone. File names which begin with a full stop and have no other full stops in them are not regarded as having an extension.\n                    For example, a file called '.myfile' has a filename of '.myfile' and a blank extension, whereas '.myfile.doc' has a file name of '.myfile.doc'\n                    and an extension of '.doc'.   This is because file names starting with a full stop are hidden files in unix file systems,\n                    and also because it is not likely that a file name would be entirely composed of a file extension, with no name before it.

The prefixes of a URI tell you what sort of resource is being described by the URI, and the exclamation marks indicate where one type of resource is contained by another.\n                    For example, for 'Spreadsheet.xls', we can see that there is a file, C:/Folder/Archive.zip, with the prefix file:/.\n                    The exclamation mark (!) tells us that the spreadsheet is contained by the Archive.zip file, and the first prefix zip:/ tells us the type of the containment is a zip file. Note that spaces in URIs are encoded by '%20', and folder separators are always forward slashes.\n                    If zip files are contained inside zip files, inside zip files, more prefixes and exclamation marks are added as needed. URIs mean that all resources profiled by DROID have a unique reference which tells you where the resource is, even if it is inside an archival file, inside another archival file, and so on.  This is something that file paths cannot do.\n                    However, both are provided, as working with file paths is easier, where they exist for a resource."

It can have zero, if DROID can't identify a format at all.one, if it is unambiguously identified as a single format.(2)  more than one, if DROID can't unambiguously decide what format it is in. In the user interface, the number in brackets indicates the number of possible format identifications made.  Clicking on the link will bring up a window showing all the identifications in a table.\n                    Multiple possible identifications can happen for three reasons. A format is identified purely on the basis of its file extension, so multiple versions of a file format may match the same extension.A format has several versions which are very similar and hard for DROID to distinguish between, so DROID will simply report all the possible versions.A file may contain patterns, purely by chance, which appear in more than one file format."

    "content": "When DROID identifies a file format, it records four pieces of information: format nameformat versionPRONOM Unique Identifier (PUID)mime-type The format name is simply a human-readable name given to a file format or family of file formats, for example, 'Microsoft Word'.\n                    The format version is the version of the format, for example '97-2003'. The PUID is a globally unique, persistent identifier for a file format and version, assigned by The National Archives through its PRONOM file format registry.\n                    For example, the PUID for the 'Microsoft Word 97-2003' file format is 'fmt/40'. PUIDs are guaranteed never to change, although new PUIDs may be defined. Clicking on a PUID in DROID will take you to the relevant page for that file format on The National Archives PRONOM website.\n                    The website will also help you with some file format names that you may be unfamiliar with. In particular, you may see files identified as 'OLE2 Compound Document Format' (PUID fmt/111) which you can interpret as 'Microsoft Office generic' .\n                    In these cases, the file is a Microsoft Office file which DROID could not identify any more closely, but the file extension may indicate more precisely. Finally, the mime-type is another scheme for identifying broad types of files in use on the internet.\n                    They are assigned by a body called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  Mime-types are quite broad classifications, so many different file formats will have the same mime-type. For example, the mime-type for 'fmt/40' is 'application/msword' which is shared by all other binary Microsoft Word formats."

    "title": "Identification methods",
    "url": "profiles.html#identification-method",
    "content": "DROID has three different methods of identifying file formats: extensionsignaturecontainer An 'extension' identification means that a format was identified purely on the basis of its file extension. Such an identification may not be reliable, as files can be named in any way, and extensions do not identify formats down to the version level, so such identifications can be quite broad, and may result in multiple identifications. A 'signature' identification means that a format was identified by finding signature patterns inside the file which are known to occur in particular file formats and versions. This method is quite reliable, as it is fairly unlikely that by chance a file will happen to have a pattern belonging to a different file format than its own. A 'container' identification means that a format was identified by finding embedded files (possibly with signatures of their own) inside the main file. For example, Microsoft Office 2007 word processing files are actually zip files containing xml files, images or other resources used in the document. A container identification would identify the main file as a Microsoft Office 2007 file, not a zip file. This method is very reliable, as not only does the broad type of container have to be identified (e.g. zip), but the zip file must then be opened, and files inside scanned for further identifications to be made.  The original zip identification is removed, and replaced by the Office 2007 identification, on the basis of the files discovered within it. Note that this is not the same as profiling files inside Archival files, even though container-format files may be based on an archival format like zip.  A container-format is a single file format, whose specification relies on specific files being inside it to define the overarching format. An archival file format is a format whose only purpose is to contain other files, and the particular files inside it has no effect on its identification as an archival format."

A content hash is a short signature that can be used to identify the content of the file. It is extremely unlikely that two different files will have the same content hash (although this is a remote possibility). Content hashes can be used to detect files with duplicate content, or can be linked to forensic hash databases to find or exclude files which are widely used (and therefore not unique to your organisation) or which contain illegal content.

In this case, the file paths are written relative to the parent file which\n                            exists on the file system. Such paths also include the type of archive as a prefix.File paths are platform-dependent (they are different on Windows and\n                            unix).\n                            DROID will write out file paths for the system on which it is currently running.\n                            This means that if you profile files on a unix machine, then export the profiles on a\n                            Windows machine, the file paths will be written out as if they were Windows file paths, and\n                            vice versa.NAMEThe file name of the resource being profiled.METHODThis field gives the method by which a resource identification has been\n                            made.Possible values:Extension- the file format was identified only by its filename extension.\n                                    This method may not be very reliable, as the filename extension may be wrong.\n                                    It is only used when DROID cannot identify a resource by another method,\n                                    and cannot usually identify what the version of a file format is, only its broad type.Signature- the file format was identified by finding a file format signature\n                                    inside\n                                    the file itself. This method is more reliable than filename extensions, and can\n                                    identify the precise version of a file format.Container- the file format was identified by finding embedded files and patterns\n                                    within them. This method is as reliable as signature identifications, and can be more\n                                    reliable.STATUSThis field gives the identification status of a resource.Possible values:Not done- the resource has not yet been profiled.Done- the resource was processed with no errors.Access denied- the operating system refused to give DROID read permissions to\n                                    the\n                                    resource.Not found- the resource was moved or deleted before DROID could read it.Error- an error occurred while trying to profile a resource. For example, if\n                                    DROID is prevented from reading a file due to the user not having read permissions to\n                                    it,\n                                    this will result in a profiling error for that file.SIZEThe size in bytes of a file.Only files have a size, folders do not have a size. However, some files\n                            can contain other files inside them, for example zip files. In this case, the zip file has a\n                            size (as it is a file), and so do the files inside it. The size reported in all cases is the\n                            uncompressed size of each file, as it would appear if extracted from the container file.TYPEThe type of the resourceDROID categorises the files and folders it profiles as being one of three types:FileFolderArchival file (e.g. zip)EXTThe file extension of the resourceExtension is the last part of a filename following a full stop. Only\n                            files have extensions, as they indicate the type of the file. Even if a folder has a full stop\n                            in its name, it will not be assigned an extension.LAST_MODIFIEDThe date and time on which a resource was last modified.EXTENSION_MISMATCHWhether there is a mismatch between the extension of the resource and\n                            its identification by signaturePossible values:true- the extension of the file is different from the expected extension as\n                                    identified by DROID.false- the extension of the file matches the expected extension as identified by\n                                    DROID.HASHHash is a fixed-size string of characters that is generated by running\n                            the contents of a file through a mathematical algorithm. DROID supports MD%, SHA1, SHA256 and\n                            SHA512 algorithmsIf you have enabledhash generationin\n                            the preferences, then this column will contain the MD5, SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512 hash for each\n                            file and archival file\n                            processed. See \"Detecting duplicate files\"\n                            for more information on hashes.FORMAT_COUNTThe number of identifications made to the resource.PUIDThe PRONOM Unique Identifier of the resource, which identifies the\n                            formatThe PRONOM Unique IDentifier (PUID) identifies the precise file format of a profiled\n                            file. When a resource has been identified, it is assigned a PUID. A unique\n                            identifier exists for every file format that DROID can recognise, and these identifiers are\n                            maintained in thePRONOMtechnical\n                            registry database, hosted at the UK National Archives.MIME_TYPEThe mime type of the resource where known.The mime-type of an identified file format is a high level format identifier assigned by theInternet Assigned Numbers. It is\n                            widely used in email and other internet protocols to identify the type of resource. Not all file\n                            formats identified by DROID\n                            have an assigned mime-type, and different PUIDs assigned by DROID can have the same mime-typeFORMAT_NAMEThe name of an identified file format, as listed in thePRONOMtechnical registry against its\n                            PUID.FORMAT_VERSIONThe version of an identified file format, as listed in thePRONOMtechnical registry against its PUID.\n                            Not all file formats have a defined version, so this field can be blank even when a file has a\n                            PUID."
