/**
 * An implementation of ResultHandlerDao which writes results out to a Writer,
 * formatting them using an ItemWriter, instead of out to the profile database.
 * This can be used to output results to CSV on the console for example, or XML to a file.
 * <p>
 * We inherit from the JDBCBatchResultHandlerDao class in order to get its
 * database operations for initialising the db and loading lists of formats.
 * Although these functions probably shouldn't belong in result handlers,
 * it's where they are now, and refactoring this turns out to be fairly
 * complex.  So we re-use all the database parts from the JDBCBatchResultHandler,
 * but override the methods involved in writing out to a Writer, and those
 * which can't work if the results aren't being saved to the database
 * (e.g. loading previous results or deleting previous results).
