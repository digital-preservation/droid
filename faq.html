                    version
                    without Java bundled, you will need to have Java 21 installed on your machine in order to run DROID.
                    The latest JAVA updates can be obtained from <a

                    re-analyse results in DROID 6 which were already obtained in earlier versions of DROID, you
                    will have to re-profile your files using DROID 6.

                <h3 class="tna-heading-m" id=why-not-recognise-formats>Why isn't DROID recognising certain formats?</h3>
                <p>
                    DROID can only recognise files for which there is a defined signature or known extension.
                    &nbsp;Signatures are regularly updated by The National Archives, and DROID can download them
                    to improve the range of formats it can identify. &nbsp;In some cases, an existing signature
                    may fail to recognise a file because the file is unusual in some way. &nbsp;If you know of
                    such files, please email <i><a href="mailto:pronom@nationalarchives.gov.uk">pronom@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a></i>
                    so we can develop better
                    signatures. &nbsp;Note that we usually require&nbsp;a sample of a failing file to find out
                    why it is not being recognised. &nbsp;Please make sure that there is no sensitive or personal
                    content in such files before sending them.

                    system?</h3>
                <p>
                    DROID&nbsp;does not record or&nbsp;display dates and times using local daylight savings
                    time, if any is configured on your system. &nbsp;The underlying dates and times are correct,
                    but represented as universal time. &nbsp;This means that, if your operating system is
                    configured to display times using daylight savings time settings, then some times can appear
                    to be one hour different to those displayed in DROID.

                <h3 class="tna-heading-m" id="can-i-configure-droid-more-accurate">Can I configure DROID to give more
                    accurate results?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. DROID 6 currently makes identifications of files based on scanning a limited amount of
                    the file. The default configuration is set to 64kb (you can change this in the
                    Tools&gt;Preferences menu). This is sufficient to return accurate identifications for most
                    file-types. There are some exceptions, for example in order to identify some uncommon formats
                    (e.g. SIARD files), you will need to scan more or all of the file. If you choose to increase
                    the amount of the file that you scan, this is likely to significantly affect the performance
                    of DROID, particularly if you have numerous large files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also configure whether DROID should match file extensions on all known formats for a
                    given file extension, or only on file extensions for which there is no other signature.
                    &nbsp;By default, DROID will only match a file extension if there is no other signature
                    defined, on the grounds that if the other (usually more accurate) signature failed, it is
                    unlikely to be the file format with that extension. &nbsp;Sometimes the more accurate
                    signatures will fail to identify a format (e.g. if a newer version has recently become
                    available). &nbsp;In these cases, you may want to turn on matching for all extensions.
                    &nbsp;This will tend to produce more identifications for&nbsp;a larger number of&nbsp;files.
                    &nbsp;More files will have identifications where they did not before, and more files will
                    have multiple identifications, instead of a single identification. &nbsp;Whether this is more
                    accurate is debatable and will depend on the files and signatures you currently have.

                    information in the file system whilst I am profiling it?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. If you are running DROID over large file stores, it is conceivable that you may need to
                    leave it running for a number of days or weeks. DROID will profile what is there at the time,
                    and so over large active locations the results will be gradually built up even while change
                    is happening. The eventual profile will therefore not reflect the entire state of your system
                    at any one time, but rather the state of each file or folder at the time DROID&nbsp;profiled
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You don&#39;t need to worry about users then changing files in the location that DROID is
                    profiling; if a file is identified in the file tree but then deleted or moved, it will be
                    recorded as an error.
                </p>
                <h3 class="tna-heading-m" id="how-long-does-profiling-take">How long does profiling take?</h3>
                <p>
                    DROID 6 is much faster than earlier versions of DROID. &nbsp;However, it depends on how much
                    and what type of information you are profiling, what level of accuracy you choose and what
                    information you need to get from the results. &nbsp;As a general rule, the larger the volume
                    of data you profile the longer it will take for the profile to complete. However DROID will
                    also take longer to complete if you chose to:
                </p>
                <ul class="tna-ul">
                    <li>

                        Create an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 hash</a>for each file

                    <li>
                        Increase the number of bytes that DROID scans in order to return an identification
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set a delay between identifying files using the throttle (to reduce the&nbsp;load on your
                        network or servers).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You will need to weigh up your requirements for accuracy, speed and what use you want to
                    make of the profiling information, setting your preferences accordingly before you begin to
                    profile your information.

                <h3 class="tna-heading-m" id="can-i-leave-droid-running">Can I set it up and just leave DROID running?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Although you need to ensure that DROID has the correct access permissions to profile
                    the locations that you have identified. Also, it is good practice to pause and save your
                    profiling at regular intervals, to ensure that if you experience an unexpected problem (such
                    as power shortage or the area that DROID is running in is affected) you can pick up your
                    profiling again without losing all your results so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also possible to set up batch files or shell scripts to automate the process and
                    produce reports when running DROID through the <a href="cli.html">command
                    line</a>. You should speak to technical specialist in your organisation for more information
                    about this.

                    systems?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, there will be some impact, but this depends on a number of factors. &nbsp;DROID does
                    not typically&nbsp;exert a high load on the file systems and networks it is running over, but
                    this will obviously depend on your particular environment and usages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DROID 6 has dynamic throttling (configurable only&nbsp;in the GUI), so if you want to limit
                    the impact on your systems you can increase the amount of time that DROID pauses between
                    identifying each file. Because it is dynamic, you can for example slow down the rate at which
                    DROID works during the day, to reduce the load on your network, then increase its speed in
                    the evening. Remember that the more you ask DROID to pause, the longer it will take to
                    complete profiling.

                <p>
                    DROID needs disk space in its working area to process <a href="#does-droid-store-copies">temporary

                    record the database of results it builds
                    up as it profiles. &nbsp;Profiles can require up to a gigabyte per two million files
                    processed.

                <p>
                    You will need to ensure that DROID 6 has the appropriate access permissions to scan the
                    repositories that it is you have requested. DROID can only profile files held in file systems
                    or systems which provide a file-system view of its files to your operating system (e.g. a
                    network share). &nbsp;
                </p>
                <h3 class="tna-heading-m" id="does-droid-store-copies">Does DROID 6 store copies of the files that it is
                    profiling?</h3>
                <p>
                    DROID 6 creates temporary files when profiling inside archival files, such as zip, tar or
                    gzip files. &nbsp;These are written out by default as ~tmp files in the <b>.droid6</b> tmp
                    directory, unless the <a href="configuration.html#temporary-files-folder">temporary folder
                    area</a> has been configured to be somewhere else. &nbsp;There are automatic cleanup
                    processes to remove information from this directory when the temporary file is no longer
                    needed, however on some occasions (such as if DROID stops unexpectedly), some files may not
                    be deleted. It is good practice to check this location regularly and remove any ~tmp files
                    that are no longer required by DROID. &nbsp;DROID&nbsp;will log a warning if it cannot delete
                    a temporary file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not possible to say how much space is required for temporary files while processing,
                    as this will depend on the size of your archival files and their contents. &nbsp;DROID also
                    profiles more than one file at a time, so more than one archival file may be being processed
                    simultaneously. &nbsp;It is prudent to ensure that you have enough space in your droid
                    working area to handle decompressing several archival files at any one point in time.
                    &nbsp;If processing very large file systems, we would recommend that at least
                    10&nbsp;gigabytes of disk space should be reserved for temporary file processing, but you may
                    require more or less depending on your files.
                </p>
                <h3 class="tna-heading-m" id="why-has-droid-stopped-profiling">Why has DROID stopped profiling before
                    completion?</h3>
                <p>
                    This may be for a number of reasons. DROID 6 has crash recovery built in, which means as
                    long as DROID has sufficient warning that a file system has become unavailable (which it may
                    not have in some instances, such as a power shortage) it will pause the current profile ready
                    to be saved and / or resumed at a later date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is good practice to pause and save your profiling at regular intervals, to ensure that if
                    you experience an unexpected problem (such as power shortage or the area that DROID is
                    running in is affected) you can pick up your profiling again without losing data.
                </p>
                <h3 class="tna-heading-m" id="why-cannot-resume-paused-profile">Why can't I resume a paused profile?</h3>
                <p>
                    Because of the crash-recovery capability built in to DROID, it is important that any of the
                    top level folders&nbsp;that are selected are not deleted, removed or renamed either during
                    profiling (if the profile is paused) or before DROID has begun to profile them. This will
                    cause the profile to pause and you will not be able to be resume it. &nbsp;This is because
                    DROID interprets a missing top-level folder as a missing file system, and it automatically
                    puts the profile into a pause mode to enable you to save your work and to resume when the
                    file system becomes available again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is best practice to select the highest folder possible when selecting the top-level
                    folders&nbsp;that you intend to profile and ensure that these are not moved, deleted or
                    renamed during or before profiling. &nbsp;If you do experience your profile stopping for this
                    reason, you can still interrogate the data that you do have. &nbsp;You can also create a new
                    profile that contains the remaining top-level items which were not profiled. &nbsp;Multiple
                    profiles can be reported on and exported together, so you will achieve the same results.

                <p>
                    Files or folders which have not yet been processed have a Not Done status in DROID.
                    &nbsp;These files and folders have not yet been recorded in the database, only in the
                    specification of what to eventually profile. &nbsp;Filtering works by querying the underlying
                    database in which DROID records its results, therefore filtering on the Not Done status
                    returns no results, even if there are files and folders visible in the main view which have
                    not yet been processed.

                    take a long time?</h3>
                <p>
                    When a filter is applied to a profile, the user interface has to do a lot of work
                    determining the status of each file or folder in the opening folder. &nbsp;Folders with lots
                    of direct files or other folders in them (i.e. many thousands) can take quite a long time to
                    open. &nbsp;This does not affect the filtering speed for exporting or reporting, so if you
                    are having problems opening a large folder with a filter, consider exporting the profile to a
                    CSV file, or running a report over it, rather than trying to open it in the user interface.

                    <li>
                        If DROID fails to start up, you may be running the wrong <a href="#java-version">version of Java</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can try moving, deleting or renaming your <code>.droid6</code> folder, as described below.
                        &nbsp;DROID will recreate a new working folder with all the default files it needs when it
                        starts up again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that your installed version of Java is accessible from where DROID is installed.
                        &nbsp;From a command-line in your droid installation folder, type "java -version". &nbsp;If
                        you don&#39;t see the Java version being displayed, you may have to configure the path to your
                        Java installation. &nbsp;Please consult the installation instructions for Java for your
                        operating system for details on how to do this.
                    </li>

                    <b>&nbsp;Deleting your .droid6 folder</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default, your <code>.droid6</code> folder is set to be created in your home directory. &nbsp;On
                    Windows, this is often found at <code>C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\.droid6</code> or <code>C:\Users\USERNAME\.droid6</code>
                    On UNIX systems, this may be found under <code>/home/USERNAME/.droid6</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are running DROID on a Mac or other Linux based system, please note that the
                    <b>.droid6</b> folder will be in the same location but will be &#39;hidden&#39;. Note that Mac
                    systems do not make hidden files easily accessible from your computer. You can delete the
                    folder&nbsp;from your machine using the command line. &nbsp;Please refer to your operating
                    system instructions for doing this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;(Please note: the location of the <b>.droid6</b> folder is <a href="configuration.html">configurable
                    using a batch file or shell script</a>, and may
                    have been set to a different location on your machine)
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default, the <b>.droid6</b> folder contains any downloaded&nbsp;binary and container
                    signature files, log files, settings, report definitions, and temporary working area,
                    although some of these can be <a href="configuration.html">configured to be in
                    different locations</a>. Please make sure you no longer require any of this information
                    before deleting. &nbsp;However, DROID will recreate all the default&nbsp;information it needs
                    by default when it runs again, effectively resetting to a new installation.
