Version 6.3
* Signature updates: Signature file release 88, Container file 20160927
* Fixes for fragment offset issues:
* (i) now checks that furthest left or right fragment is valid in terms of the overall sequence offset from BOF or EOF.
* e.g. see https://github.com/digital-preservation/droid/issues/104.
* (ii) now includes 'backtracking' behaviour where an intermediate fragment led to a failed identification because
* a subsequent fragment offset does not match. The code now checks for a further valid occurrence of the intermediate
* fragment that led to the failure, and if one is found, resumes checking for subsequent fragments from that point.
* e.g. see https://github.com/digital-preservation/droid/issues/82
* Fix for issue whereby there were sometimes no identifications found for the first profile run after installing
* a new signature file (https://github.com/digital-preservation/droid/issues/97)
