// Use this file to list those test suite skeleton files in the parent directory's fmt and x-fmt sub directories, where
// DROID is not expected to return an identification.
// Normally we would expect the identification to match the start of the filename e.g. x-fmt-384-signature-id-212.mov
// to be identified as x-fmt/384.
// Enter each file on a new line.  You may add comments on the same line by using a tab separator, also entries can be
//commented out by prefacing with //.
